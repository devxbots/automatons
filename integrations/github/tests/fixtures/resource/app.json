  "description": "checkbot is a GitHub App that combines [required status checks](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/configuring-branches-and-merges-in-your-repository/defining-the-mergeability-of-pull-requests/troubleshooting-required-status-checks) with [filters](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#using-filters) for GitHub Actions. It makes it possible to skip workflows based on a filter, and still require jobs in the workflow to succeed if they run.",
