# ðŸ¤– Automatons

_An automation framework for developers._

This project implements a set of tools and components to automate software
development workflows. At its core, _automatons_ perform a series of actions
when they are triggered by an outside event.

The project is in an early prototyping phase, and not yet ready for public use.
